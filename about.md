Undoubtedly one of the great minds of our time, Lefebvre de Saboya challenged his readers to think deeply on topics of politics, religion, war, and science. Also, yes, this is a lie!

Lefebvre de Saboya was born in December 1980, in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, where he lived until he was 5 years old. Afterward, he moved with his parents and sister to Olinda, Recife, Natal, Brasília and finally returned to Campo Grande in 1990. Until he was 16, he proved to be a great student.

At 17, adolescence brought him rebellion: Lefebvre refused to attend classes because he found them boring.

Lefebvre de Saboya admired the poets of the 19th century and wanted to experience the same bohemia as his inspires. Had several loves made and broken. He wrote the most beautiful poems declaring his love, hatred, resentment, and hope.

A demonstration of Lefebvre's curmudgeon in 2002, during the physics major. He argued with teachers who underestimated his reasoning ability. He did not attend classes anymore. He failed all subjects due to lack of frequency, but he obtained grade A in all the tests of the semester.

Lefebvre de Saboya lived in Rio de Janeiro, where he wrote short stories, essays and began the production of his first novel. He left when the opportunity found him.

In 2012, he accepted, naively, a great challenge. Lefebvre did not know that when he entered that big commercial retail bank, his destiny would change.

For five long years, he lived in those bank branches, isolated from the outside world and away from family and friends. He understood that, for his survival, he needed to learn the routine and rituals of that merciless reality. He worked intelligently, obtaining incredible results, which were essential for his survival.

Without ever giving up hope, he finally conquered freedom in 2018. His dismissal process is one of the fastest in the institution's history - the final chapter of a reality that today is one of the bank's legends.
Even today, their stories are whispered in the corridors by the people who still live there, despite the constant vigilance of the superintendents and executives controlling the place.

Lefebvre de Saboya deserves his recognition for not succumbing to  “current” trends in literature and for preserving the characteristics of good authors.
